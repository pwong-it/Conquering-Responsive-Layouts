# Conquering-Responsive-Layouts
This is my way of documenting my progress through the responsive layout course by Kevin Powell. It is a 21-day course that is drip fed to students and each day, there will be new content and challenge to tackle and complete. At the end of the course, I'll know how to create a responsive webpage correctly.
